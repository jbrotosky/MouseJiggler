# Auto Jiggler

A mouse jiggler completely made in Powershell. This is so hopefully you can run it without anti-virus/whitelisting programs stopping another mouse jiggling program like caffine, and you don't have to buy a mouse jiggling USB.


## Features

- Customizable Time

If you set the time below 2000 milliseconds, it might be a challenge to stop the mouse jiggling program.




## Run Locally

Download the file, right click the file, and press "Run with Powershell". After this, in between jiggles click your chat program you want to stay active in. I am unsure of other programs, but Microsoft Teams will still show you're away unless you click into Teams while this is running
